# IEEE 14 bus system
Number of scenarios: 250 .. 2000 in steps of 250
Algorithms: Full model and decomposition 
k: 5
Aim: To justify the need for a decomposition algorithm
Other details: Solve decomposition to optimality and record time; have CPX_PARAM_TILIM of 3600 seconds on full model and record gap
